Leveraging the state-of-the-art capabilities of blockchain technology and IPFS, Skillified creates a seamless, transparent, and secure environment for course creation, enrollment, examination, and certification. This document serves as a comprehensive guide, detailing the platform's innovative features, intricate smart contract structure, vital dependencies, and streamlined setup instructions. Welcome to the future of education â€“ welcome to Skillified.

## Overview
Skillified is more than just an education platform, it is a holistic educational ecosystem that seamlessly integrates with the Ethereum blockchain and IPFS to bring trust, integrity, and innovation to learning. The platform is ingeniously designed to facilitate the creation, enrollment, and certification of various courses, ensuring an unparalleled level of integrity, transparency, and verifiability of educational achievements.

The functionality of Skillified is orchestrated through three main user roles: **Admin**, **Instructor**, and **Student**, each designed to serve specific purposes and interactions within the platform:

- **Admin**: Oversees and manages the entire platform, including course creation and content management.

- **Instructor**: Imparts knowledge and skills through courses, supervises student progress, and certifies achievements.

- **Student**: Enrolls in courses, accesses learning materials, takes exams, and earns verifiable certificates.

Skillified's integration with Ethereum and IPFS not only brings credibility to educational credentials but also opens up new pathways in the world of digital learning. Join us on this journey towards a decentralised and authenticated education system.

- **View Certificates**: View and download certificates of completed courses.

## My Certificates
Once the student has enrolled and viewed the course material they are prompted to take the exam, which is 10 multiple choice questions that directly correspond to the course material. Once the student has submitted their exam the result is recorded on chain and if the student has passed the exam a certificate of completion for the course is issued & displays in the student portal under the "My Certificates" title. The student then has the option to download the certificate as a PDF.

## Exams
Skillified provides a robust examination system that aligns with the courses offered, ensuring a comprehensive assessment of a student's understanding and skills. Here's how the examination process is designed and executed within the platform:

**Exam Creation**:
- **Admin Role**: The platform's admin is responsible for defining the exams associated with each course. This includes specifying the title of the exam and linking it to the corresponding course.

- **Question Structure**: Each exam consists of multiple-choice questions that are directly related to the course material. Questions are structured with a clear query, a set of options, and a correct answer index.

- **Inclusion in Course**: The exams are an integral part of the courses and are accessible to students after enrollment.

**Conducting Exams**:
- **Student Interaction**: Students can take the exams through an intuitive interface that displays the questions and allows selection of answers.

- **Answer Collection**: Student answers are collected during the exam, allowing for immediate evaluation.

- **Result Evaluation**: The system evaluates the student's responses by comparing them with the correct answers defined in the question structure.

**Recording Results on Blockchain**:
- **Transaction Creation**: Upon submitting the exam, a transaction is created to record the result on the blockchain.

- **Pass/Fail Determination**: The system determines whether the student has passed or failed based on the correct answers.

- **Blockchain Entry**: The result, along with relevant details such as course ID and pass/fail status, is recorded on the blockchain, ensuring transparency and immutability of the exam outcome.

## Metadata Creation
The data contained within the metadata Ipfs hash is stored off chain for easy access and verification from third parties.
Metadata associated with the certificate includes vital information like certificate ID, course title, course fee, instructor address, student details, enrollment date, exam status, and completion date.

It includes:
1. `certificate_id`
2. `course_title`
3. `course_fee`
4. `instructor_address`
5. `student_name`
6. `student_address`
7. `enrollment_date`
8. `exam_status`
9. `completion_date`

**JSON Format**: The metadata is structured in JSON format, allowing for easy parsing and accessibility.
![metadata_ipfs_hash](resources/images/user_interface/metadata_ipfs_hash.png)
**Pinning to IPFS**:
- **File Pinning**: The certificate metadata is pinned to IPFS, a decentralised storage system.
- **IPFS Hash**: The unique IPFS hash ensures the availability and integrity of the certificate and metadata, allowing for verifiable access from anywhere.

- **Integration with Smart Contract**: The IPFS hash is integrated with the corresponding smart contract, linking the certificate to the on-chain record.

## Certificate Generation and Download
Upon successful completion of a course and passing the associated exam, students are awarded a certificate. The certificate generation and download process is a blend of technology and aesthetics, ensuring a meaningful representation of the student's achievement.

**PDF Generation**:
- **Certificate Template**: A certificate image serves as the background for the PDF, enhancing its visual appeal.

- **Custom Information**: The PDF includes personalised details such as the student's name, course title, and completion date, formatted with custom styles.

- **File Creation**: The certificate is generated as a downloadable PDF file, available directly from the platform.

The certificate generation and download features not only bring elegance to the certification process but also instill confidence and credibility through their integration with blockchain technology and IPFS.

By encapsulating the complete life cycle of exams and certificates within a secure and transparent environment, Skillified stands as a symbol of innovation in education, setting new standards for assessment and recognition of learning.

## Smart Contract Structure
The Skillified `LearningPlatform` smart contract is underpinned by Solidity and utilises ERC721Enumerable for certificate issuance.

The contract enables the platform to provide a comprehensive solution for online education, integrating course management, student enrollment, certificate issuance, and examination functionalities within a decentralised environment.
